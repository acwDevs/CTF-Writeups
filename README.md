This is the beginning of a blog I am starting to post all of the writeups I make on ctf competitions I have been a part of.

<h1>idekctf2024</h1>  
<p>
    One of my first CTF's this one was a bit harder than expected but im glad I was able to figure out at least one of the reverse engineering challenges. Its the only category I worked on.

    I had a great time working on this ctf. I think this one was aimed more towards beginners but it felt very welcoming and gave me some confidence in my ctf skills.
